### Project Summary: Movie Recommendation System

**Title**: Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

**Description**: Developed a movie recommendation system leveraging machine learning algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences and movie similarities.

**Details**:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collected data from a public dataset containing movie details, including titles, overviews, genres, keywords, and cast.
   - Preprocessed the data by normalizing, cleaning, and transforming it into a structured format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted relevant features such as genres, keywords, and cast.
   - Employed techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical vectors.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implemented a content-based filtering approach using cosine similarity to calculate the similarity scores between movies.
   - Built a recommendation function that suggests movies based on the input movie title by finding the closest matches in the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using various metrics to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the model as a web application using Flask.
   - Integrated the model with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input a movie title and receive recommendations.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Flask, Pickle
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

**Key Contributions**:
- Successfully developed and deployed a robust movie recommendation system with high accuracy.
- Implemented efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
- Optimized the recommendation algorithm through rigorous evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

Now, I'll proceed to extract relevant details from the `app.py` file to complete the project description.
